# RANK-OF-A-MATRIX
## Aim:
To write a python program to find the rank of a matrix
## Equipment’s required:
1. 	Hardware – PCs
2. 	Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner
## Algorithm:
### Step 1: 
importing numpy as np
### Step 2: 
assigning matrix to A
### Step 3: 
Using the np.linalg.matrix_rank(), we can find the rank of the given matrix.
### Step 4: 
assigning b to the rank of the matrix and then printing the rank of the matrix b.
### Program:

# Program to find the rank of a matrix.
# Developed by: YENDLURI CHANDANA
# RegisterNumber:23011258
```
import numpy as np

A=[[1,2,3],[1,2,3]]

b=np.linalg.matrix_rank(A)

print(b)
```

## Output:

## Result:
Thus the rank for the given matrix is successfully solved by  using a python program.
